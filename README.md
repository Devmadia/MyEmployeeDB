  Initiate a clone or pull of a project's repo onto your local machine, then change directory to file location and run installation for dependencies by typing `npm install` in the root directory terminal window.

  ## Usage
  Before doing anything, be sure to run the schema.sql  and seeds.sql files to get your MySQL database created. You will need to know how to use MySQL and have it installed for this.
