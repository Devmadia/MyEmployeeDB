  ## Installation
  Initiate a clone or pull of a project's repo onto your local machine, then change directory to file location and run installation for dependencies by typing `npm install` in the root directory terminal window.

  ## Usage
  Before doing anything, be sure to run the schema.sql  and seeds.sql files to get your MySQL database created. You will need to know how to use MySQL and have it installed for this.

  Once everything is installed, users can run the application by typing `node server.js` in the terminal window of the root directory the Employee Tracker Database was installed in. A detail should pop up in the terminal window similar to the screenshot above with options available for selection through keyboard arrow keys.
